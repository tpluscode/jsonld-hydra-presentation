## Linked Data

### Pragmatic Semantic Web

1. Use URIs as names for things
2. Use HTTP URIs
3. When someone looks up a URI, provide useful information
4. Include links to other URIs

note:

2. ... so that people can look up those names

3. ... using the standards (RDF*, SPARQL)

4. ... so that they can discover more things
