##  Hypermedia As The Engine Of Application State

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
hypermedia controls within resource representation

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
all application state transitions must be driven by client selection of server-provided choices

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
client requires no additional or up-front knowledge

<!-- .element: class="fragment"  style="color: green"-->
_except some initial resource URI_

<!-- .element: class="fragment" style="color: red" -->
_and understanding of the format_

note:
URI doesn't have to be the entrypoint (think browser bookmarks)

state transition means __client state__ and not __server state__
